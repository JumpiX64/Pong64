#Pong-N64#

Pong-N64 is a minimalist port of the classic Pong game that runs on a real Nintendo 64 console.
The project was created as an experiment in low-level programming, C development, and the open-source framework Libdragon.
The goal was to understand the fundamentals of hardware-level code while gaining practical experience with the N64 architecture.
